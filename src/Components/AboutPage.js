      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have a deep passion for coding that ignited during my high school years. Ever since then, I've been immersed in the world of programming. While most of my coding projects have been school-related, I've also dedicated my skills to projects for personal enjoyment and my business.</p>
      <p> In school, I tackled various coding challenges, enhancing my skills and knowledge. However, I didn't limit my coding journey to the classroom. I undertook fun, creative projects, exploring new technologies and honing my coding prowess. Additionally, I leveraged my coding skills to benefit my business, optimizing processes and developing solutions to meet the specific needs of my venture.</p>
      <p>This journey has not only been intellectually rewarding but also personally fulfilling, and I look forward to continuing my coding adventures with enthusiasm.</p>
